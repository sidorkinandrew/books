# https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/
# Some commonly used decorators that are even built-ins in Python are @classmethod, @staticmethod, and @property. The @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators are used to define methods inside a class namespace that are not connected to a particular instance of that class. The @property decorator is used to customize getters and setters for class attributes. Expand the box below for an example using these decorators.

# The following definition of a Circle class uses the @classmethod, @staticmethod, and @property decorators:

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius

    @property
    def radius(self):
        """Get value of radius"""
        return self._radius

    @radius.setter
    def radius(self, value):
        """Set radius, raise error if negative"""
        if value >= 0:
            self._radius = value
        else:
            raise ValueError("Radius must be positive")

    @property
    def area(self):
        """Calculate area inside circle"""
        return self.pi() * self.radius**2

    def cylinder_volume(self, height):
        """Calculate volume of cylinder with circle as base"""
        return self.area * height

    @classmethod
    def unit_circle(cls):
        """Factory method creating a circle with radius 1"""
        return cls(1)

    @staticmethod
    def pi():
        """Value of π, could use math.pi instead though"""
        return 3.1415926535

      
#In this class:

#.cylinder_volume() is a regular method.
#.radius is a mutable property: it can be set to a different value. However, by defining a setter method, we can do some error testing to make sure it’s not set to a nonsensical negative number. Properties are accessed as attributes without parentheses.
#.area is an immutable property: properties without .setter() methods can’t be changed. Even though it is defined as a method, it can be retrieved as an attribute without parentheses.
#.unit_circle() is a class method. It’s not bound to one particular instance of Circle. Class methods are often used as factory methods that can create specific instances of the class.
#.pi() is a static method. It’s not really dependent on the Circle class, except that it is part of its namespace. Static methods can be called on either an instance or the class.
