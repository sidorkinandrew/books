#A test case answers a single question about the code it is testing. A test case should be able to...
#...run completely by itself, without any human input. Unit testing is about automation.
#...determine by itself whether the function it is testing has passed or failed, without a human interpreting the results.
#...run in isolation, separate from any other test cases (even if they test the same functions). Each test case is an island.

# Every individual test is its own method. A test method takes no parameters, returns no value, and must have a name beginning with the four letters test. If a test method exits normally without raising an exception, the test is considered passed; if the method raises an exception, the test is considered failed.
