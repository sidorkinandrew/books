#A test case answers a single question about the code it is testing. A test case should be able to...
#...run completely by itself, without any human input. Unit testing is about automation.
#...determine by itself whether the function it is testing has passed or failed, without a human interpreting the results.
#...run in isolation, separate from any other test cases (even if they test the same functions). Each test case is an island.
